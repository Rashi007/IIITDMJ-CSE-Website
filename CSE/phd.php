                            The selected candidates who have completed all the formalities of their previous degree, including project/ thesis examination/ viva voce, before the last date of registration but are unable to produce the certificate in proof of having passed and secured the minimum specified qualifying marks, may be provisionally registered in the programme. However, if registered provisionally, a student shall be required to produce the evidence of his/her having passed qualifying degree/ examination with minimum specified marks by the last date for document submission as specified in the academic calendar (usually about 8 weeks from the date of registration) failing which his/her provisional registration may be cancelled.
                        </p>
						<p>
                            In exceptional cases, a student admitted in the programme, who has paid his/her fee but is unable to register within the late registration date due to valid reasons, may request for the deferred admission. On the recommendation of the concerned faculty/discipline, the Chairperson Senate may allow the deferment of admission for the duration not normally exceeding by one semester. However, all cases of deferred admissions shall be required to be ratified by the Senate and may stand cancelled otherwise.
